# Project Title

## Description
This project demonstrates an OpenGL application using GLUT and GLEW libraries. It is designed to showcase graphical rendering techniques.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- Ensure you have OpenGL, GLUT, GLEW, and a g++ compiler installed on your system.

### Installing and Running the Program
1. Open Linux/Unix Terminal
   
2. Navigate to the directory containing `project.cpp` and all supporting files.
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   
3. Install Supporting packages: -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lGLEW

   For installing, follow these commands:

   sudo apt update

   sudo apt install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev

   sudo apt install libglew-dev


### Do not delete any supporting files as they are essential for running the program.

### Compile
Compile the program using the following command:

g++ project.cpp -o run -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lGLEW


Run the compiled program:

./run
